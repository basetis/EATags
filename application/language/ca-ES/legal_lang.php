          <p>We invite you to access our web sites and use our Service (as defined below),
            but please note that your invitation is subject to your review and agreement
            with certain terms and conditions. These terms and conditions are set forth
            in this document, and in certain other policies, guidelines and other terms
            or conditions that may be presented to you from time to time at other locations
            in our web sites in connection with specific Service offerings
            (all of which may be updated from time to time and are collectively referred
            to as our “Terms of Service”).</p>
          <p>You need not accept this requirement to agree to our Terms of Service,
            but if you reject our Terms of Service you do not have any right to access
            or use our Service. If you do access our web site and use our Service,
            your use shall be deemed to accept the Terms of Service and be a party to
            a legally binding contract with Base Technology & Information Services SL
            (“BaseTIS”, “we” and sometimes “us”). Of course, you may also be required
            or elect to enter into a separate written agreement or click “accept” or
            “agree” to become a party to another contract with BaseTIS
            (a “Separate Agreement”), and these Terms of Service shall
            not be considered to supersede the specific contractual terms of the Separate Agreement.
            If there is any contradiction between the terms of the Separate Agreement and these Terms
            of Service, then the terms of the Separate Agreement shall take precedence over the contradictory
            terms in the Terms of Service with respect to the subject matter of such Separate Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>You may wish to save a copy of these Terms of Service for your records.
            In any event, be sure to regularly check these Terms of Service for any updates or other changes,
            which shall be legally binding upon you when we post them, whether or not we provide you any other
            notice of such changes. The then-applicable Terms of Service will be posted at www.evernote.com/tos,
            and we will indicate the effective date of each update at the top of the Terms of Service.
            Your continued use of the Service after any update will be deemed to represent your consent to
            be bound by, and agreement with, the new Terms of Service.</p>

          <h3>4. PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
          <p>
            Our Privacy Policy is published at www.eatgas.com/privacy/. By using the Service, you acknowledge,
            accept and agree with all provisions of the Privacy Policy, including, without limitation,
            the use of your Account Information and your Content in accordance with such Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h3>5. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, LICENSES AND LIMITATIONS</h3>
          <p><strong>BaseTIS Rights</strong></p>
          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that BaseTIS(and any licensors to BaseTIS) own(s) all legal right,
            title and interest in and to the Service, including, without limitation, all software comprising
            a part of the Service that is either hosted on BaseTIS’ servers or deployed by you or a third party
            to enable clipping of Content originating at another party’s web site, such as the Site
            Memory widget (the “Software”), and all intellectual property rights therein (whether
            registered or not and wherever existing in the world). You further acknowledge and agree
            that the rights in the Service, including all intellectual property rights, are protected by
            one or more of copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, regulations and treaties, in addition to these Terms of Service and any Separate Agreement. Except for the limited license rights specifically granted to you in these Terms of Service (and any rights expressly granted to you in a Separate Agreement), BaseTIS and its suppliers own and shall retain all rights, title and interests, including, without limitation, intellectual property rights, in and to the Service and all Software utilized therein (and all copies thereof and related materials that are delivered or made available to you with the Service).
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to enable BaseTIS to operate the Service, we must obtain from you certain license and other rights to the Content you submit (so that our processing, maintenance, storage, technical reproduction, back-up and distribution, and related handling of your Content doesn’t infringe applicable copyright and other laws). Accordingly, by using the Service and posting Content, you grant BaseTIS a license to display, perform and distribute your Content, and to modify (for technical purposes) and reproduce such Content to enable BaseTIS to operate the Service. (You also agree that BaseTIS has the right to elect not to accept, post, store, display, publish or transmit any Content in our sole discretion.) You agree that these rights and licenses are royalty free, irrevocable and worldwide, and include a right for BaseTIS to make such Content available to, and pass these rights along to, others with whom BaseTIS has contractual relationships related to the provision of the BaseTIS Service, solely for the purpose of providing such services, and to otherwise permit access to your Content to third parties if BaseTIS determines such access is necessary to comply with its legal obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except for the limited license and other rights granted in these Terms of Service, you retain all of the rights you had in your Content before you submitted it; unless you elect to enable others to view or have access to the Content you submit to the Service, no one else should see your Content without your consent. Of course, if you do elect to publish and share any portion of your Content by placing it into one or more Shared Notebooks, then, in doing so, you are enabling each of those permitted users of the BaseTIS Service access to use, display, perform, distribute and modify your Content (subject to any understandings or agreements you and such users may work out without BaseTIS’ involvement).
          </p>
          <p><strong>Your Rights</strong>
          <p>
            As indicated above, you retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Service. Other than the limited license and other rights you grant in these Terms of Service, BaseTIS acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms of Service in or to any Content that you submit, post, store, transmit or display on, or through, the Service, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). You agree that you are solely responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that BaseTIS has no obligation to do so on your behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            BaseTIS hereby grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the Software provided to you by BaseTIS as part of the Service as provided to you by BaseTIS, for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as permitted by these Terms of Service, until your rights are terminated in accordance with these Terms of Service.
          </p>
